RUNNING THE GAME:

For windows PCs, please open the MazeMonster.exe file to launch the game. 
For any other OS, try the MazeMonster.jar file, which may run on your 
machine if the version of java is up to date. 

Note: If the executable files are moved to a seperate folder from the res 
file, the game will not work, as this folder contains the resources.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Guide the dog through the maze using the W,A,S,D keys to move. You must 
collect 10 bones before being able to exit the maze and start the next level.
